					 <p>Too often, Muslims are seen as terrorists and Islam as the religion of terrorism. Some media outlets foster misinformation and hate by conflating Islam and Islamism. As a Muslim myself, I am tired of hearing all the misconceptions around Muslims and Islam. Every time an act of terror or shooting occurs, Muslims closely watch the news with extreme trepidation praying that the suspect is not Muslim. This is not because these terrorists are likely to be Muslim but rather because in the instances where they happen to be, we see amplified mass media coverage and extreme unjustified hatred towards Muslims. I am tired of hearing the phrase “Mentally disabled” being used instead of “terrorist” when the suspect in an attack is not Muslim. It is time to silence this islamophobia with facts and stats. I read a lot of articles, gathered statistics and visualized them to help make sense of the situation in my next five points.  </p>

						<li> <strong>Non-Muslims make up the majority of terrorists in the United States:</strong> According to the FBI, 94% of terrorist attacks carried out in the United States from 1980 to 2005 have been by non-Muslims. This means that an American terrorist suspect is over nine times more likely to be a non-Muslim than a Muslim. According to this same report, there were more Jewish acts of terrorism in the United States than Islamic, yet when was the last time we heard about the threat of Jewish terrorism in the media? For the same exact reasons that we cannot blame the entire religion of Judaism or Christianity for the violent actions of those carrying out crimes under the names of these religions, we have absolutely no justifiable grounds to blame Muslims for terrorism. <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terrorism-2002-2005">see link</a><br><br>

						<li> <strong>Non-Muslims make up the majority of terrorists in Europe:</strong> There have been over one thousand terrorist attacks in Europe in the past five years. Take a guess at what percent of those terrorists were Muslim. It’s less than 2%. <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/less-than-2-percent-of-terrorist-attacks-in-the-e-u-are-religiously-motivated-cec7d8ebedf6/">see link</a> <br>

						<li> <strong>Even if all terrorist attacks were carried out by Muslims, you still could not associate terrorism with Islam:</strong> There have been 140,000 terror attacks committed worldwide since 1970. Even if Muslims carried out all of these attacks, those terrorists would represent less than 0.00009 percent of all Muslims. To put things into perspective, this means that you are more likely to be struck by lightening in your lifetime than a Muslim is likely to commit a terrorist attack during that same timespan. <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/">see link</a> </li>

					 <ul>
					 	<li><strong>If all Muslims are terrorists, then all Muslims are peacemakers:</strong> The same statistical assumptions being used to falsely portray Muslims as violent people can be used more accurately to portray Muslims as peaceful people. If all Muslims are terrorists because a single digit percentage of terrorists happen to be Muslim, then all Muslims are peacemakers because 5 out of the past 12 Nobel Peace Prize winners (42 percent) have been Muslims. <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/">see link</a> <br><br> <img src="noblePrize.png" alt="stats" class="center" style="width:300px;height:400px;">

					 <ul>
					 	<li><strong>If you are scared of Muslims then you should also be scared of household furniture and toddlers:</strong> A study carried out by the University of North Carolina showed that less than 0.0002% of Americans killed since 9/11 were killed by Muslims. Based on these numbers, and those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the average American is more likely to be crushed to death by their couch or television than they are to be killed by a Muslim. As a matter of fact, Americans were more likely to be killed by a toddler in 2013 than they were by a so-called “Muslim terrorist”. <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov//PageFiles/108985/tipover2011.pdf">see link</a> </li>

					 <p>When a drunk driver causes a car accident, we never blame the car manufacturer for the violent actions of that driver. This is because we understand that we cannot blame an entire car company that produces millions of safe vehicles just because one of their cars was hijacked by a reckless person who used it to cause harm. So what right do we have to blame an entire religion of over 1.6 Billion peaceful people because of the actions of a relatively insignificant few?</p>
